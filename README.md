#) What is Adapter Design Pattern in .Net core??
The Adapter Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows incompatible interfaces to work together by converting one interface into another that a client expects.

In .NET Core projects, it is used to:
‚úÖ Integrate third-party APIs with different response formats.
‚úÖ Allow legacy code to work with new interfaces.
‚úÖ Enable dependency injection for flexible and scalable solutions.
‚úÖ Ensure loose coupling and separation of concerns in application architecture.

#) In above health insurance aggregator project, we needed to fetch insurance plans from multiple third-party insurance providers. Each provider had a different API structure.

We used the Adapter Pattern to create a common interface and implemented separate adapters for each provider. The adapters transformed provider-specific responses into a standardized format, making the integration seamless.

**IInsuranceProviderAdapter** ‚Äì Common interface.
**ProviderAAdapter** and **ProviderBAdapter** ‚Äì Converted data into a unified InsurancePlan model.
**InsuranceAggregator** ‚Äì Fetched data from all providers using DI in .NET Core.
This approach ensured scalability, flexibility, and maintainability.

#) How does the Adapter Pattern help in unit testing in .NET Core?
Answer:
‚úÖ Dependency Injection (DI): Since adapters implement a common interface (IInsuranceProviderAdapter), we can mock them easily in unit tests.
‚úÖ Decoupling from third-party services: We can test the business logic without calling actual third-party APIs.

#) How would you extend the Adapter Pattern if a new insurance provider needs to be added?
Answer:
Adding a new provider requires minimal changes:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a new service class for the provider (e.g., ProviderCService).
2Ô∏è‚É£ Implement an adapter (ProviderCAdapter) that transforms its response into a standard format.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Register the new adapter in Program.cs:
**builder.Services.AddTransient<IInsuranceProviderAdapter, ProviderCAdapter>();**
The InsuranceAggregator will automatically pick up the new provider without modifying existing code.
This follows the Open-Closed Principle (OCP) from SOLID.

#) How do you handle exceptions in the Adapter Pattern while integrating third-party APIs?
Answer:
When integrating third-party APIs, handling network failures, timeouts, and invalid responses is crucial.

üîπ Best Practices:
‚úÖ Use try-catch blocks in the adapter to handle API failures.
‚úÖ Implement policies using Polly for retry and circuit breaker mechanisms.

#)  How does the Adapter Pattern follow SOLID principles?
Answer:
‚úÖ Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Each adapter only handles one provider's API transformation.
‚úÖ Open-Closed Principle (OCP): New providers can be added without modifying existing code.
‚úÖ Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Any adapter can be replaced with another without breaking functionality.
‚úÖ Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): The adapters implement only the required interface (IInsuranceProviderAdapter).
‚úÖ Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): The application depends on the abstraction (interface) rather than concrete classes.
